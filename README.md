The Gym Membership and Fitness Management System is a comprehensive console-based application developed in C++ to optimize gym management and provide structured fitness guidance. The system comprises two modules: an admin module with full access to features such as member account creation, detail modification, record viewing, and deletion; and a member module, allowing users to manage their profiles, view personal details, and receive tailored fitness suggestions. SQLite integration is utilized for the storage and retrieval of diet and workout plans across muscle building, maintenance, and weight loss categories. Additionally, C/C++ graphics libraries are employed to enhance the user interface by incorporating images and enabling mouse responsiveness. Custom header files, including HANDLECLICKS for mouse movement detection, diet_database for diet plan management, DRAWPAGES for image rendering, and CAPTUREINPUTS for real-time input display, further streamline the system's functionality.
